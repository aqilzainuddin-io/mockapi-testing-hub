# Assumptions & Limitations - MockAPI Testing Hub

## Assumptions
- MockAPI behaves like a real REST API
- Each test is independent
- IDs auto-increment and are unique
- API supports standard CRUD operations without authentication

## Limitations
- Limited to features provided by MockAPI
- Manual tests require Postman to execute
- Automation scripts will initially cover basic CRUD only
- No concurrency or stress testing
